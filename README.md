## Installation

This package is using [react-native-reanimated](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/fundamentals/getting-started). It should be installed first. 

```bash
npm install react-native-reanimated react-native-gesture-handler && cd ios && pod install
```

Then

```bash
npm install react-native-number-animate
```




## !! IMPORTANT !!

‚Ä¢ __lineHeight__ in textStyle prop and __textHeight__ prop must be __THE SAME__ (Default value is the 25 for both)

‚Ä¢ for iOS, you can use just __fontSize__ prop in textStyle prop but it makes glitch in Android when you do not use __lineHeight__. 

‚Ä¢ DO NOT FORGET to use __overflow:"hidden"__ and __flexDirection:"row"__ when you change style of container

```javascript
<AnimatedNumber 
    number={number}
    textStyle={{
        fontSize: 25,
        color: "#fff",
    l   ineHeight: 25
    }}
    textHeight={25}
    containerStyle={{
        height: 25,
        flexDirection: 'row',
        overflow: "hidden"
    }}
/>

```
## Basic Usage

```javascript
import AnimatedNumber from 'react-native-number-animate';

function App() {
  return <AnimatedNumber number={number}/>
}
```
