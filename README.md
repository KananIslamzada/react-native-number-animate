## Installation

This package is using [react-native-reanimated](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/fundamentals/getting-started). It should be installed first.

```bash
npm install react-native-reanimated react-native-gesture-handler && cd ios && pod install
```

Then

```bash
npm install react-native-number-animate
```

## !! IMPORTANT !!

‚Ä¢ **lineHeight** in textStyle prop and **textHeight** prop must be **THE SAME** (Default value is the 25 for both)

‚Ä¢ for iOS, you can use just **fontSize** prop in textStyle prop but it makes glitch in Android when you do not use **lineHeight**.

‚Ä¢ DO NOT FORGET to use **overflow:"hidden"** and **flexDirection:"row"** when you change style of container

```javascript
<AnimatedNumber
    number={number}
    textStyle={{
        fontSize: 25,
        color: "#fff",
    l   ineHeight: 25
    }}
    textHeight={25}
    containerStyle={{
        height: 25,
        flexDirection: 'row',
        overflow: "hidden"
    }}
/>

```

## Basic Usage

```javascript
import AnimatedNumber from "react-native-number-animate";

function App() {
  return <AnimatedNumber number={number} />;
}
```
